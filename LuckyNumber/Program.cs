            //Part 2

            // The program should randomly generate 6 numbers using a loop
            // The randomly generated numbers should be stored in an array
            // Numbers should be displayed to the console as such and using a loop (Numbers below are for example only. Format must be exact):
            //Lucky Number: 12
            //Lucky Number: 47
            //Lucky Number: 28
            //Lucky Number: 3
            //Lucky Number: 19
            //Lucky Number: 35
            //Part 3

            // Hard - code a value for the jackpot amount and let the user know what the jackpot amount is at some point you decide in the program.

            //   The program should count the number of correctly guessed numbers and output to the console to notify the user.Example:
            //You guessed 3 numbers correctly!
            //   The program should calculate the user's winnings based on the number of numbers guessed correctly.

            //   The user's winnings should be output to the console. Example:
            //  You won $256, 877.23!
            //  Part 4


            //   Ask the user if the user would like to play again.
            // If the user says yes, then the program should run again from the beginning.
            // If the user says no, then the program should say "Thanks for playing!"(Must be exact statement).
            //Stretch Tasks:

            // Make your program ensure none of the generated numbers are repeated.For example, the following is a valid output:
            //            Lucky Number: 12
            //Lucky Number: 47
            //Lucky Number: 28
            //Lucky Number: 3
            //Lucky Number: 19
            //Lucky Number: 35
            //But, the following output is invalid because 12 is generated twice.
            //Lucky Number: 12
            //Lucky Number: 47
            //Lucky Number: 28
            //Lucky Number: 3
            //Lucky Number: 19
            //Lucky Number: 12
            //If there is a repeated number, replace it with a new number.Do this until there are no repeated numbers.
